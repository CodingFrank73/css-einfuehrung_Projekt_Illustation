absurd illustrations that make sense
What about absurd illustrations for your projects? Take every user on an individual journey through their own imagination.
real beauty resides in imperfection
In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with something more human that will make us appreciate both the beauty and the imperfection of something made by hand.
expressiveness is... the new black
This series of illustrations paradoxically combines absurdity and a deep sense of childishness and naivety.
illustrations for applications
Welcome to my space for experiments! Look at this like a journey we can take together every step of the way, beginning another chapter with each new phase of the project development. And who knows where it will take us?
examples of use
Each illustration offers the possibility of limitless interpretations and uses and everyone can give it its own meaning. It depends only on each one's creativity and free spirit.
